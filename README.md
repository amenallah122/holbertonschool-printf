# holbertonschool-printf
a function that produces output according to a format.

Please note that this version of _printf focuses on fundemantal formatting options which are '%c', '%s', '%i and '%d', and does not include advanced features such as flag characters , field width, precision , or length modifiers .


| Format specifier            | Output                                                               |
| ----------------- | ----------------- |
| %c | Character |
| %s | String |
| %d | Decimal |
| %i | integer |

This version is still under work so it can't fully replace the standard printf function.

To build this function , we organized the code into multiple files , each one is dedicated to a specific operation, as outlined below :
